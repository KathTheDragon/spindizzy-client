Could store character description/properties client-side and have client-side character editing & puppet creation
- If you're connected, hitting 'save' would immediately generate all the commands for making the changes
- If you're not, then the next time you connect it goes and does that
- If you happen to use the MUCK character editor yourself, it'll detect it and automatically update the offline copy

Isolate networking from rest of client
- Have a `Connection` class with `send` and `receive` methods. Each instance is a separate connection to Spindizzy, buffers lines received from the server until they're requested.
